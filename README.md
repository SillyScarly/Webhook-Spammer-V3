# Webhook-Spammer-V3

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First you need to install the required modules into cmd. The required modules will be listed below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Pip install requests
-Pip install Fore
-Pip install pyfiglet
-Pip install Figlet
-Pip install colorama

After installing the required modules to run the application, simply insert your webhooks into the webhooks.txt file in your folder and save changes. After that is completed, continue onto the proxy.txt folder and insert your Private/Public HTTP(s) proxies and save changes.

Once all the steps above have been completed, Run the application and enjoy!

Note : If you're using public proxies, eventually your proxies will get burnt or overloaded due to the fact that most public proxies have limited bandwidth. It is best to raid with private proxies as they have Unlimited bandwidth and can make your raid last forever until the webhook is deleted. However, many public http(s) proxies you have that are in high amounts can last a decent amount of time as do keep in mind, the more the better. 

Enjoy!
